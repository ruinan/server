## Description

## Dependencies

Except the `react` and `react-dom`, these dependencies applied: 
| Name | Usage |
|:------:|:------:|
| body-parser | Parse Request Body data |
| mongodb & mongoose | Communicate with MongoDB with ORM |
| socket.io | Handle websocket requests  |
| nodemon | developing tool that automatically rerun the server for applying changes |

### Design
It generated by the express-generator. I followed the default app structure that removed the unnecessary server rendering parts.

The file will handle the HTTP requests under the routes folder. It does not do much about error handling.

The DB initiation and schema are in the DB folder. It can use to generate a connection and create the schema for data.

For the convenience, the socket part integrated into the app.js because it is only a media to passing the message.

### Result
It successfully handles the requests, WebSocket connections, store and fetches data from the database.
